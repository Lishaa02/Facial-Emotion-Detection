#  Real-Time Emotion Detection 

This project is a real-time facial emotion detection system built using deep learning and computer vision techniques. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify facial expressions into 7 categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise. The trained model processes live webcam video to detect faces and display the predicted emotion on the screen.

 Features
Real-time face detection using OpenCV.

Emotion classification using a CNN trained on grayscale face images.

Interactive live webcam predictions.

Model trained with image augmentation for better generalization.

 Tech Stack
Python
